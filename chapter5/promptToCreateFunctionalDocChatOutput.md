# EmployeeController API Documentation

## Overview

The `EmployeeController` class is part of the `com.hendisantika.springboot.swagger.controller` package and is responsible for handling HTTP requests related to Employee entities. It utilizes services defined in [`EmployeeService`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fworkspaces%2Fspring-boot-swagger%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fhendisantika%2Fspringboot%2Fswagger%2Fservice%2FEmployeeService.java%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A16%2C%22character%22%3A13%7D%5D "src/main/java/com/hendisantika/springboot/swagger/service/EmployeeService.java") to perform business logic operations and interacts with Employee data.

## Dependencies

- **Spring Boot**: Framework for creating stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications.
- **Swagger**: Used for API documentation. Annotations from Swagger are used to describe API endpoints and their parameters.
- **SLF4J**: Simple Logging Facade for Java, used for logging purposes.
- **Spring Web**: Provides the functionality for building web applications with Spring, including RESTful service components.

## API Endpoints

### General Structure

The controller is expected to define several RESTful endpoints to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on [`Employee`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fworkspaces%2Fspring-boot-swagger%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fhendisantika%2Fspringboot%2Fswagger%2Fmodel%2FEmployee.java%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A16%2C%22character%22%3A13%7D%5D "src/main/java/com/hendisantika/springboot/swagger/model/Employee.java") entities. Common endpoints would include:

- **List Employees**: Retrieve a list of all employees.
- **Get Employee**: Retrieve a specific employee by their ID.
- **Create Employee**: Add a new employee to the system.
- **Update Employee**: Update the details of an existing employee.
- **Delete Employee**: Remove an employee from the system.

### Annotations

- `@RestController`: Indicates that the `EmployeeController` is a RESTful controller.
- `@RequestMapping`: Defines the base URL path for the API endpoints managed by this controller.
- `@Autowired`: Automatically injects the [`EmployeeService`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fworkspaces%2Fspring-boot-swagger%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fhendisantika%2Fspringboot%2Fswagger%2Fservice%2FEmployeeService.java%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A16%2C%22character%22%3A13%7D%5D "src/main/java/com/hendisantika/springboot/swagger/service/EmployeeService.java") dependency.
- `@ApiOperation`, `@ApiParam`, etc.: Swagger annotations used to describe the purpose of each API endpoint and its parameters for documentation and tools.

### Response Types

Responses are typically wrapped in `ResponseEntity` objects, allowing for flexible HTTP status and headers configuration. Common response statuses include:

- **200 OK**: Request was successful, and the requested data is returned.
- **201 Created**: A new entity was successfully created.
- **400 Bad Request**: The request was malformed or invalid.
- **404 Not Found**: The requested entity was not found.
- **500 Internal Server Error**: An unexpected error occurred on the server.

## Security and Permissions

Details on security configurations and permissions required to access these endpoints would depend on the broader application security setup, which might involve Spring Security.

## Error Handling

The controller likely implements error handling to return appropriate HTTP status codes and messages when exceptions occur, though specifics are not provided in the excerpt.

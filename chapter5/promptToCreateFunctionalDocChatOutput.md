Error Handling

All endpoints return appropriate HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of an API call. Common responses include:

    200 OK: The request was successful.
    201 Created: A new resource was successfully created.
    404 Not Found: The requested resource was not found.
    400 Bad Request: The request was invalid or cannot be served.

Security

The API does not explicitly detail authentication or authorization mechanisms, so it's assumed to be either open or managed externally.
Usage Example

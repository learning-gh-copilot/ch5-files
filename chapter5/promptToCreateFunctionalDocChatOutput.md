To create functional documentation for the various public APIs in `EmployeeController.java`, we will follow these steps:

1. **Identify Public APIs**: Look through `EmployeeController.java` to identify all public methods. These typically represent the endpoints or functionalities exposed by the controller.

2. **Method Signatures**: For each public method, document its signature, including the return type, method name, and parameters.

3. **Endpoint Mapping**: Document the specific request mapping (e.g., `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`) for each method, including the URL path and the HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.).

4. **Parameters**: Describe each parameter, including its type, whether it's required or optional, and its purpose.

5. **Return Type**: Explain the return type of each method, including the structure of any object returned or the status code for HTTP responses.

6. **Exceptions**: Note any exceptions that can be thrown by each method and under what circumstances.

7. **Usage Examples**: Provide a brief example of how to call the API, including example request and response bodies if applicable.

8. **Additional Annotations**: Document any additional annotations used within the methods that affect their behavior (e.g., `@RequestBody`, `@PathVariable`).

9. **Security Considerations**: Mention any security-related annotations or mechanisms in place, such as authentication or authorization checks.

10. **Deprecation Notices**: Highlight any methods that are deprecated and suggest alternatives if available.

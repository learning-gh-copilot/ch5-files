The provided code excerpts from the workspace do not explicitly detail the API endpoints, their parameters, or return types within the EmployeeController.java file. However, based on the standard practices and the annotations used in the controller, we can infer some general information about how an API in such a controller might be structured.

Given the use of @RestController and @RequestMapping(value = "/employees") annotations, the EmployeeController class is likely to expose HTTP endpoints related to employee operations under the /employees path. The use of @Api annotation with a description suggests that this controller's endpoints are documented using Swagger, which provides a UI for interacting with the API and viewing its specifications.

Typically, an EmployeeController might include operations such as:

    Listing all employees
    Finding an employee by ID
    Adding a new employee
    Updating an existing employee
    Deleting an employee

For these operations, the parameters and return types could be as follows:

    List all employees:
        Parameters: None or optional query parameters for filtering.
        Returns: A list of Employee objects.

    Find an employee by ID:
        Parameters: Employee ID (path variable).
        Returns: An Employee object or a 404 error if not found.

    Add a new employee:
        Parameters: An Employee object in the request body.
        Returns: The added Employee object with a 201 status code.

    Update an existing employee:
        Parameters: Employee ID (path variable) and the updated Employee object in the request body.
        Returns: The updated Employee object or a 404 error if not found.

    Delete an employee:
        Parameters: Employee ID (path variable).
        Returns: A status message or a 404 error if not found.

To get the exact details of the API endpoints, their parameters, and return types, you would need to look at the method signatures and annotations within the EmployeeController.java file. Additionally, the Swagger UI at http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html as mentioned in the README.md would provide a comprehensive and interactive documentation of all available API endpoints, their expected parameters, and the structure of their response bodies.

The key documentation extracted from the provided code and workspace structure highlights the setup and functionality of a Spring Boot application with Swagger integration for API documentation. Here's a summary:

### Project Structure
- **Maven Wrapper**: Ensures a consistent build environment by using a specific Maven version without requiring it to be installed on machines that build the project.
- **Spring Boot Application**: The main application is located at [`SpringbootSwaggerApplication.java`](src/main/java/com/hendisantika/springboot/swagger/SpringbootSwaggerApplication.java).
- **Swagger Configuration**: Swagger is configured in [`SwaggerConfig.java`](src/main/java/com/hendisantika/springboot/swagger/SwaggerConfig.java) to document the REST API.
- **Employee Management**: The application includes an employee management system with a model ([`Employee.java`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolInFile?%5B%22src%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fhendisantika%2Fspringboot%2Fswagger%2Fmodel%2FEmployee.java%22%2C%22Employee.java%22%5D "src/main/java/com/hendisantika/springboot/swagger/model/Employee.java")), a service ([`EmployeeService.java`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolInFile?%5B%22src%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fhendisantika%2Fspringboot%2Fswagger%2Fservice%2FEmployeeService.java%22%2C%22EmployeeService.java%22%5D "src/main/java/com/hendisantika/springboot/swagger/service/EmployeeService.java")), and a controller ([`EmployeeController.java`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolInFile?%5B%22src%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fhendisantika%2Fspringboot%2Fswagger%2Fcontroller%2FEmployeeController.java%22%2C%22EmployeeController.java%22%5D "src/main/java/com/hendisantika/springboot/swagger/controller/EmployeeController.java")).

### Maven Dependencies
- **Spring Boot Starter Web**: For building web, including RESTful, applications using Spring MVC. Uses Apache Tomcat as the default embedded container.
- **Spring Boot Starter Data JPA**: For using Spring Data JPA with Hibernate.
- **Spring Boot Starter Actuator**: Provides production-ready features to help you monitor and manage your application.
- **MySQL Connector Java**: MySQL JDBC driver for database connectivity.
- **Lombok**: For reducing boilerplate code in Java classes.
- **Springfox Boot Starter**: For integrating Swagger 2 into Spring Boot applications.
- **JFairy**: For generating fake data for testing.

### Swagger Integration
- Swagger is enabled and configured through the [`SwaggerConfig.java`](src/main/java/com/hendisantika/springboot/swagger/SwaggerConfig.java) file. It uses annotations to generate documentation for the REST API.
- The Swagger UI can be accessed at `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html`, as mentioned in the [`README.md`](README.md).

### Running the Application
- The application can be built and run using Maven Wrapper scripts ([`mvnw`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fworkspaces%2Fspring-boot-swagger%2Fmvnw%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/workspaces/spring-boot-swagger/mvnw") for Unix/Linux and [`mvnw.cmd`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fworkspaces%2Fspring-boot-swagger%2Fmvnw.cmd%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/workspaces/spring-boot-swagger/mvnw.cmd") for Windows).
- The Maven [`pom.xml`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fworkspaces%2Fspring-boot-swagger%2Fpom.xml%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/workspaces/spring-boot-swagger/pom.xml") file specifies the project dependencies and build configuration.

### Documentation and Testing
- The [`README.md`](README.md) file provides basic information about accessing the Swagger UI for testing the API endpoints.
- Unit tests are located under the `test` directory, with the main test class being [`SpringbootSwaggerApplicationTests.java`](src/test/java/com/techupskills/springboot/swagger/SpringbootSwaggerApplicationTests.java).

This summary encapsulates the essential aspects of the project based on the provided workspace structure and code excerpts.

GitHub Copilot: The last command run in the terminal was `ls`, which lists the contents of the current directory. The command was executed in the `/workspaces/op-new` directory. The output of the command shows the files and directories present in that directory:

- **Dockerfile**: A file containing instructions to build a Docker image.
- **Makefile**: A file containing a set of directives used by the `make` build automation tool.
- **PROJECT**: A directory, likely containing project-specific files.
- **README.md**: A Markdown file typically containing information about the project.
- **api**: A directory, likely containing API-related code.
- **config**: A directory, likely containing configuration files.
- **controllers**: A directory, likely containing controller code.
- **go.sum**: A file containing checksums of dependencies for a Go project.
- **main.go**: The main Go source file, typically the entry point of the application.
- **go.mod**: A file defining the module's dependencies for a Go project.
- **hack**: A directory, possibly containing scripts or tools for development.
- **oryxBuildBinary**: A file, possibly a binary or script related to the build process.

This output gives an overview of the structure and contents of the `/workspaces/op-new` directory.

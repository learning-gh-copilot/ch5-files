techupskills: create some unit tests for #file:EmployeeController.java 

GitHub Copilot: To create unit tests for the [`EmployeeController`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fworkspaces%2Fspring-boot-swagger%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fhendisantika%2Fspringboot%2Fswagger%2Fcontroller%2FEmployeeController.java%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A20%2C%22character%22%3A13%7D%5D "src/main/java/com/hendisantika/springboot/swagger/controller/EmployeeController.java") class, we will follow these steps:

1. **Setup Mock Environment**: Mock the [`EmployeeService`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fworkspaces%2Fspring-boot-swagger%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fhendisantika%2Fspringboot%2Fswagger%2Fservice%2FEmployeeService.java%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A16%2C%22character%22%3A13%7D%5D "src/main/java/com/hendisantika/springboot/swagger/service/EmployeeService.java") to return predefined data for testing.
2. **Instantiate [`EmployeeController`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fworkspaces%2Fspring-boot-swagger%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fhendisantika%2Fspringboot%2Fswagger%2Fcontroller%2FEmployeeController.java%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A20%2C%22character%22%3A13%7D%5D "src/main/java/com/hendisantika/springboot/swagger/controller/EmployeeController.java")**: Create an instance of [`EmployeeController`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fworkspaces%2Fspring-boot-swagger%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fhendisantika%2Fspringboot%2Fswagger%2Fcontroller%2FEmployeeController.java%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A20%2C%22character%22%3A13%7D%5D "src/main/java/com/hendisantika/springboot/swagger/controller/EmployeeController.java") with the mocked [`EmployeeService`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fworkspaces%2Fspring-boot-swagger%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fhendisantika%2Fspringboot%2Fswagger%2Fservice%2FEmployeeService.java%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A16%2C%22character%22%3A13%7D%5D "src/main/java/com/hendisantika/springboot/swagger/service/EmployeeService.java").
3. **Define Test Cases**:
   - Test [`getAllEmployees`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fworkspaces%2Fspring-boot-swagger%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fhendisantika%2Fspringboot%2Fswagger%2Fcontroller%2FEmployeeController.java%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A28%2C%22character%22%3A34%7D%5D "src/main/java/com/hendisantika/springboot/swagger/controller/EmployeeController.java") method to ensure it returns all employees correctly.
   - Test [`searchEmployeeById`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fworkspaces%2Fspring-boot-swagger%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fhendisantika%2Fspringboot%2Fswagger%2Fcontroller%2FEmployeeController.java%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A43%2C%22character%22%3A34%7D%5D "src/main/java/com/hendisantika/springboot/swagger/controller/EmployeeController.java") method with a valid ID and ensure it returns the correct employee.
   - Test [`filterEmployeesByAge`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fworkspaces%2Fspring-boot-swagger%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fhendisantika%2Fspringboot%2Fswagger%2Fcontroller%2FEmployeeController.java%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A62%2C%22character%22%3A34%7D%5D "src/main/java/com/hendisantika/springboot/swagger/controller/EmployeeController.java") method to ensure it filters employees correctly by age.
   - Test [`filterEmployeesByCity`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fworkspaces%2Fspring-boot-swagger%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fhendisantika%2Fspringboot%2Fswagger%2Fcontroller%2FEmployeeController.java%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A78%2C%22character%22%3A34%7D%5D "src/main/java/com/hendisantika/springboot/swagger/controller/EmployeeController.java") method to ensure it filters employees correctly by city.
   - Test [`filterEmployeesByAgeAndCity`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fworkspaces%2Fspring-boot-swagger%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fhendisantika%2Fspringboot%2Fswagger%2Fcontroller%2FEmployeeController.java%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A98%2C%22character%22%3A34%7D%5D "src/main/java/com/hendisantika/springboot/swagger/controller/EmployeeController.java") method to ensure it filters employees correctly by both age and city.
   - Include tests for error handling scenarios.

Here's how the unit tests could be structured in Java using JUnit and Mockito:

```java
import static org.mockito.Mockito.*;
import static org.junit.Assert.*;
import org.junit.Before;
import org.junit.Test;
import org.mockito.InjectMocks;
import org.mockito.Mock;
import org.springframework.http.HttpStatus;
import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;

import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

public class EmployeeControllerTest {

    @Mock
    private EmployeeService employeeService;

    @InjectMocks
    private EmployeeController employeeController;

    private Employee employee1, employee2;

    @Before
    public void setUp() {
        employee1 = new Employee(/* initialize with test data */);
        employee2 = new Employee(/* initialize with test data */);

        when(employeeService.getAll()).thenReturn(Arrays.asList(employee1, employee2));
        when(employeeService.getEmployeeById(1)).thenReturn(employee1);
        when(employeeService.filterByAge(30)).thenReturn(Arrays.asList(employee1));
        when(employeeService.filterByCity("CityName")).thenReturn(Arrays.asList(employee2));
        when(employeeService.filterByAgeAndCity(30, "CityName")).thenReturn(Arrays.asList(employee1));
    }

    @Test
    public void testGetAllEmployees() {
        ResponseEntity<Object> response = employeeController.getAllEmployees();
        assertNotNull(response);
        assertEquals(HttpStatus.OK, response.getStatusCode());
        assertTrue(((List) response.getBody()).size() == 2);
    }

    @Test
    public void testSearchEmployeeById() {
        ResponseEntity<Object> response = employeeController.searchEmployeeById(1);
        assertNotNull(response);
        assertEquals(HttpStatus.OK, response.getStatusCode());
        assertEquals(employee1, response.getBody());
    }

    @Test
    public void testFilterEmployeesByAge() {
        ResponseEntity<Object> response = employeeController.filterEmployeesByAge(30);
        assertNotNull(response);
        assertEquals(HttpStatus.OK, response.getStatusCode());
        assertTrue(((List) response.getBody()).contains(employee1));
    }

    @Test
    public void testFilterEmployeesByCity() {
        ResponseEntity<Object> response = employeeController.filterEmployeesByCity("CityName");
        assertNotNull(response);
        assertEquals(HttpStatus.OK, response.getStatusCode());
        assertTrue(((List) response.getBody()).contains(employee2));
    }

    @Test
    public void testFilterEmployeesByAgeAndCity() {
        ResponseEntity<Object> response = employeeController.filterEmployeesByAgeAndCity("schoolId", 30, "CityName");
        assertNotNull(response);
        assertEquals(HttpStatus.OK, response.getStatusCode());
        assertTrue(((List) response.getBody()).contains(employee1));
    }

    // Additional tests for error handling scenarios can be added here
}
```

This pseudocode outlines the basic structure and approach for testing the `EmployeeController`. You'll need to adjust the mock data initialization and assertions based on the actual `Employee` class structure and the business logic of your application.
